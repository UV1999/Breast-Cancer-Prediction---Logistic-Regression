# Breast-Cancer-Prediction---Logistic-Regression
This is my new repository for Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression. 

I will use the UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer dataset.
The dataset used in this story is publicly available and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin 
Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA. To create the dataset Dr. Wolberg used fluid samples, taken from patients with solid breast masses and
an easy-to-use graphical computer program called Xcyt, which is capable of perform the analysis of cytological features based on a digital
scan. The program uses a curve-fitting algorithm, to compute ten features from each one of the cells in the sample, than it calculates the 
mean value, extreme value and standard error of each feature for the image, returning a 30 real-valuated vector
